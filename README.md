- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Saswat Behera. I love to code and design architectures that are reliable, scalable, closed for modification, open for extension and support building resilient and predictive softwares.
- **About this microservice:** This is an OCR microservice that currently leverages the functionality of IronOCR. It uses trial license. Any company that intends to use it commercially, is free to do so using a commercial license of IronOCR.
- Alternatively, if any company wishes to use this architecture and the wrapper code, leverage the Dependency Injection in this project, but want to replace IronOCR with any other OCR library, may do so. Only the Biz layer needs to be plugged into new library. The rest of code base may remain the same.

- ðŸ“« For any questions or queries, you can reach me at saswat1983@gmail.com
